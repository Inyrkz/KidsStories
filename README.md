# KidsStories
Creating a popularity recommender system that recommends popular stories based on the the age of the kid

This model uses the likes and dislikes column of the stories.csv file to sort through the books and recommend the most popular book for that age.
The likes are sorted in descending order, while the dislikes column is sorted in ascending order.
From the dataset, the age range is from 0-13 years.

The Kids Stories Documentation.docx file gives more details on the workflow of the project
